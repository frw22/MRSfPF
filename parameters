function [pars] = parameters
%PARAMETERS function for storing simulation parameters
%   The output is a structure 'pars' with the following fields:



% Specify the length(s) of the domain on which to simulate. These values
% are not used for non-spatial simulations; a 1D simulation will be
% performed on an interval of length Lx, a 2D simulation will be performed
% on a rectangle of dimensions Lx-by-Ly 
Lx = 128;
Ly = Lx;

% Specify the characteristic particle size 
womega = 2^(-8);

% "Nx", "Ny": the numbers of lattice voxels in the x- and y- directions.
% These values are not used for non-spatial simulation. For 1D simulation,
% Nx specifies the number of voxels in the (regular) lattice
Nx = 2^9;
hx = Lx/Nx;
Ny = Nx;
hy = Ly/Ny;

% Specify the number of dimensions for the simulation
dmns = 0;

% "vol": a positive scalar specifying the volume of each lattice voxel. For
% the non-spatial simulations, this is the volume of the reaction vessel
if dmns == 0
    vol = Lx/womega;
elseif dmns == 1
    vol = hx/womega;
elseif dmns == 2
    vol = hx*hy/womega;
end

% "rates": a 1xN vector containing the (positive) reaction rates, where N
% is the number of reactions in the reaction scheme
rates = [ 0.75, 1, 0.7, 0.125];

% "T_fin": a (positive) scalar specifying the final time to simulate the
% system until
T_fin = 200;

% "rec", "ht", "E": rec is an integer specifying the type of recording to
% be implemented. Currently there are three options coded:
rec = 1;
% 1: record the system state at regular time points: ht, 2*ht, 3*ht, ...
% where ht is a specified interval
ht = 2^(-2);
% 2: record the time and system state after every E reaction events, where
% E is a specified integer
E = 10^4;
% 3: record the time and system state after every reaction event


% "diffs": a 1xS vector containing the positive species diffusivities,
% where S is the number of species in the system
diffs = [ 1, 10 ]/(hx^2);

% "max_react_on": a logical variable specifying whether the simulation may
% terminate prematurely if a specified number of reaction events is
% exceeded. To turn this termination condition OFF, set max_react_on to be
% FALSE.
max_react_on = false;
% "R_max": If the termination condition is ON, then the cutoff number of
% reaction events is specified by the integer R_max: 
R_max = 2.5 * 10^11;
